# ChatServer

ChatServer developed as a beginning of the second year university project by Manuel Furia. It supports rooms, private messaging, permissions, query searches, kicking, banning, room blacklististing and whitelisting.
The project is developed in kotlin, in arount two weeks of course time, by mainly making use of immutability objects and functional style.
After developing, the project was slightly modified to interact with a ChatClient for android developed later in the same course.
